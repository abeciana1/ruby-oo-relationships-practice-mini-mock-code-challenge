Overall Assessment: 2.5/5

Comments: 

Overall a pretty good job with one big mistake in the refactor. The `author.books` method will return a list of publishers and it should actually return a list of books. Make sure you're testing your code carefully. 

Other than that, I can tell that you understood the relationships just be careful of errors like this one that could break your entire app.
